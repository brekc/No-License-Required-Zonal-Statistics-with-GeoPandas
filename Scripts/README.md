## ArcGIS Python Environment Setup

> [!WARNING]
> File paths will vary based on your operating system.

Configure an ArcGIS Python environment to include GeoPandas and Rasterio before trying the Python scripts. You can add GeoPandas, Rasterio, and other packages to a default ArcGIS Python environment with the [Deep Learning Libraries Installers for ArcGIS](https://github.com/Esri/deep-learning-frameworks) or create a new environment. If you want to create a new Python environment through ArcGIS Pro:

1. **Clone the default environment**\
Settings &rarr; Package Manager &rarr; Environment Manager &rarr; Clone arcgispro-py3 &rarr; Save the environment to ..\ESRI\conda\envs or ..\anaconda3\envs

![](/Scripts/ArcGIS_Env_Setup/Clone_Env.png)

2. **Activate the cloned environment, then open the Python Command Prompt**\
Search "Python Command" and make sure it is located in ..\ArcGIS\Arc Pro\
You should see the cloned environment (arcgispro-gpd-rio for this example) listed in the Python Command Prompt

3. **You will 'conda activate' the cloned environment and install from the Esri channel (conda install -c esri)**

Use 'conda activate' if the environment is not activated

```
conda activate arcgispro-gpd-rio
```

Then install Fiona, GeoPandas, and Rasterio

```
conda install -c esri fiona geopandas rasterio
```

> [!Tip]
> You can try pip install if you have issues with conda install.

```
pip install fiona geopandas rasterio
```

> [!Note]
> You can also clone the environment with the Anaconda command prompt, but use the arcgispro-py3 path for your installation.   

```
conda create --name arcgis_pro --clone C:\Users\brekc\AppData\Local\Programs\ArcGIS\Pro\bin\Python\envs\arcgispro-py3
```

```
conda env list
```

```
conda activate arcgis_pro
```

```
conda install -c esri fiona geopandas rasterio
```

4. **Open the Python scripts (.py)**

If you are working with an IDE, set the Python interpreter of the target environment:

**[Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/python-tutorial):** View &rarr; Command Palette &rarr; Python: Select Interpreter

![](/Scripts/ArcGIS_Env_Setup/VS_Code_Python_Interp.png)

**[Pycharm Community](https://www.jetbrains.com/help/pycharm/configuring-python-interpreter.html#):** Settings &rarr; Project &rarr; Python Interpreter &rarr; Add Python Interpreter
> [!NOTE]
> You will need to create a project for ..\No_License_Required-Zonal_Statistics_With_GeoPandas\Scripts.

**[Spyder](https://docs.spyder-ide.org/current/faq.html):** Preferences &rarr; Python Interpreter

![](/Scripts/ArcGIS_Env_Setup/Spyder_Python_Interp.png)

> [!NOTE]
> You can also activate environments and launch IDEs through Anaconda Navigator.

5. **Run gdb_setup.py first to test your setup and create the geodatabase needed for the other scripts**

## Batch file (.bat) Setup

The zonal_statistics_gpd_arcgis_cmd.py script is an example of how to build command-line tools with [argparse](https://docs.python.org/3/library/argparse.html). Edit zonal_statistics_gpd_arcgis_cmd.txt to include the desired Python interpreter and path to zonal_statistics_gpd_arcgis_cmd.py:

1. **Open zonal_statistics_gpd_arcgis_cmd.txt in a text editor**

![](/Scripts/ArcGIS_Env_Setup/Txt_to_Bat_1.png)

Edit the paths for the Python interpreter and zonal_statistics_gpd_arcgis_cmd.py script.

3. **Save as batch (.bat) file**

![](/Scripts/ArcGIS_Env_Setup/Txt_to_Bat_4.png)
   
4. **Test by dragging and dropping the batch file into a command prompt or terminal, type -h, then enter to see the help message**

A command for the geodatabase from gdb_setup.py will look like:

```
C:\Users\brekc\No-License-Required-Zonal-Statistics-With-GeoPandas\Scripts\zonal_statistics_gpd_arcgis_cmd.bat -gdb C:\Users\brekc\No-License-Required-Zonal-Statistics-With-GeoPandas\Scripts\zonal_statistics_gpd_arcgis.gdb -zone Redmond_Roads -raster King_Co_2021_Ext_Perc -touched On -output zonal_stats_test
```
